# Optimize resource loading
As a page loads, many resources are referenced within its HTML that provide a page with its appearance and layout through CSS, as well as its interactivity through JavaScript. In this module, a number of important concepts related to these resources and how they affect a page's load time are covered.

## Render blocking
CSS is a render-blocking resource, as it blocks the browser from rendering any content until the CSS Object Model (CSSOM) is constructed. The browser blocks rendering to prevent a Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC), which is undesirable from a user experience standpoint.

## Parser blocking
"Parser blocking" refers to the behavior where the browser’s HTML parser pauses while loading certain resources, preventing the rest of the HTML from being processed until those resources are fully loaded. This is especially common with CSS and JavaScript files.

### How Parser Blocking Works
- CSS Blocking: The browser must fully load and parse CSS files before rendering any part of the page because CSS directly impacts layout and styling. When a <link rel="stylesheet"> tag is encountered, the HTML parser stops, waits for the CSS to load, and only then continues parsing and rendering the HTML. This behavior ensures that the page doesn't flash unstyled content (also known as a "flash of unstyled content" or FOUC).
- JavaScript Blocking: When the HTML parser encounters a <script> tag, it stops parsing and executing HTML until the script has been downloaded, parsed, and executed (unless the async or defer attribute is used). This can significantly delay page rendering, especially if the JavaScript file is large or slow to load.

### Mitigating Parser Blocking
  - To reduce parser blocking, consider these strategies

#### Load JavaScript Asynchronously: Use the async or defer attributes on "script" tags, allowing HTML parsing to continue while the script loads.

```

<script src="script.js" async></script>
<script src="script.js" defer></script>
```

- Minimize CSS Blocking: Place only essential CSS in the main CSS file and use @media queries or load additional styles asynchronously if they are not needed for initial rendering.
- Inline Critical CSS: Inline small amounts of critical CSS directly in the HTML <head> to enable faster initial rendering.
- By reducing parser-blocking resources or loading them strategically, you can improve page load times and provide a faster, smoother experience to users.


## CSS optimizing technique
- Minification
- Remove unused CSS


## @import / "link rel='stylesheet'"
```
Using <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" /> is generally more efficient than @import url('style.css'); for loading CSS. Here’s why:
```

### Loading Behavior:
```
The <link> tag allows the browser to start downloading the CSS file immediately as it encounters the link in the HTML.
With @import, especially if placed inside another CSS file, the browser must first load and parse that initial CSS file
before it can start fetching the imported styles, causing a delay.
Better Parallel Loading:
Browsers can load multiple <link>-based stylesheets in parallel, whereas @import often causes them to be loaded sequentially, slowing down overall load time.
```
### Compatibility:
```
<link> is supported by all browsers and does not rely on any specific order of execution.
@import can lead to compatibility issues with older browsers and can be problematic for performance optimizations.
```
### Best Practice
For optimal performance, use 'link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" ' in the <head> of your HTML document rather than @import within a CSS file. 
This approach ensures faster and more efficient loading of CSS resources.
