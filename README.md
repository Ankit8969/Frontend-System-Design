# Progressive Web Apps
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that use modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience to users. They combine the best of both web and mobile apps, 
offering features such as offline access, push notifications, fast loading times, and the ability to be added to the home screen like native apps.


***A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a web app that uses progressive enhancement to provide users with a more reliable experience, uses new capabilities 
to provide a more integrated experience, and can be installed. And, because it's a web app, it can reach anyone, anywhere, on any device, all with a single codebase. 
Once installed, a PWA looks like any other app, specifically:***

- It has an icon on the home screen, app launcher, launchpad, or start menu.
- It appears when you search for apps on the device.
- It opens in a standalone window, wholly separated from a browser's user interface.
- It has access to higher levels of integration with the OS, for example, URL handling or title bar customization.
- It works offline.

## Bringing the best of both worlds
| Web | Platform apps |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| Linkability     | Offline-capable     | 
| Accessible by default     | High performance     | 
| Ubiquitous     | Rich and reliable     |
| Easy to Deploy     | Device Integration     |
| Easy to Update     | Standalone experience     |
| Everyone can publish     | Installed Icon     |
| Ubiquitous     | Rich and reliable     |



```
Note: People tend to think of Progressive Web Apps as an app that the user can install from a browser instead of an app store. However, a PWA can be
listed in many app stores today as an optional distribution channel, including Google Play Store (for Android and ChromeOS), Microsoft Store (for Windows 10 and 11),
and Apple AppStore (for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS). For these cases, you must follow all store rules and requirements, but you will still get some of the advantages of a PWA.
